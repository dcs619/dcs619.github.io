Hey there!  I'm a professional developer, trainer, listener, and problem solver.  I work remotely in [Greenville, SC](http://lifeingreenville.com) for [Kingdom First](https://kingdomfirstsolutions.com).  I currently manage internal systems development for our team as well as external projects with contractors.

Want to connect, chat, or ask a question?  My [DM's](/contact) are always open.

### My Background

I was a senior web developer for over 5 years at NewSpring Church, who had 35k weekly attendees, 180k+ user profiles, and 19 locations across South Carolina.  I led the transition to and development of Rock RMS as a single source of truth to automate internal processes, retool the user portal, and leverage native apps.

Before that, I worked as a software contractor for law enforcement, as a network analyst for a law firm, and a few other roles where I tried to take something apart, break it, and get it working again.
