title: About
---

Hey there! I'm a developer and database nerd who loves Jesus, my wife [Karli](http://instagram.com/karlijstevens), code, and music.

Most days you can find me developing projects for [Kingdom First](https://kingdomfirstsolutions.com) and pushing open-source code for [Rock RMS](http://rockrms.com).

When I'm not writing code, I love kayaking, hiking, or cycling around beautiful [Greenville, SC](http://lifeingreenville.com).
