I'm a professional developer, trainer, listener, and problem solver.  I work remote in beautiful [Greenville, SC](http://lifeingreenville.com) as a senior software developer and consultant for [Kingdom First](https://kingdomfirstsolutions.com).   I get excited about sushi, music, card games, spreadsheets, and the outdoors, but not usually in that order.

Want to connect, chat, or ask a question?  My [DM's](/contact) are always open.

### My Background:

I was the senior developer for over 5 years at NewSpring Church, who had 35k weekly attendees, 150k+ user profiles, and 19 locations across South Carolina.  I led the transition to and development of Rock RMS as a single source of truth to automate internal processes, revamp their user portal, and build native apps.

Before that, I worked as a law enforcement software contractor, law firm network architect, and other jobs where I usually tried to take something apart, break it, then get it back working again. 


### Biography:
