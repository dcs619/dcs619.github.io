Hey, I'm David! I'm an engineering lead located in [Greenville, SC](http://lifeingreenville.com) with 20+ years of full-stack expertise in enterprise and open source software. I've been fortunate to work in product, agency and management roles where I learned the value of collaboration and efficiency to drive organization success.

Currently I lead two engineering teams to create, optimize, and deliver .NET software for mid-size to Fortune 500 clients. My day-to-day ranges from personal mentoring, code reviews and client onboarding, to architecting projects and planning sprints. 

Want to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidclarkestevens/), [chat](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=218521189), or [ask a question](hello@davidstevens.us)?  I'm always up for a conversation.

### My Background

For the past 5 years, I've guided engineering teams in various capacities and roles.  As a development director, I recruited and mentored direct reports, closed sales opportunities, and planned and presented strategic growth plans.  As a product owner, I engaged clients through technical roadmapping, estimation, design, documentation and implementation.  As a team lead, I provided hands-on expertise and collaborative solutions to meet deadlines and promote team improvements.

As an individual contributor, I led development and ETL processes of an open-source .NET CRM and CMS designed for non-profits.  I designed and optimized microservices and API's for Azure and on-premise environments, ensuring best practices for security, performance, and uptime.  Tooling I built directly converted over 50M+ records from proprietary systems, saving at least $1M per year in licensing costs.  At scale, this system supported React Native apps for an organization with 35k weekly attendees, 180k+ user profiles, and 19 locations across South Carolina.

Prior to that, I worked as a software contractor for law enforcement, as a network analyst for a law firm, and a few other roles where I tried to take something apart, break it, and get it working again.

### My Biography

He loves finding ways to be more efficient, doing things with intensity, and sleeping outdoors whenever he can.
