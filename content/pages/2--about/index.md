I'm a professional developer, trainer, listener, and problem solver.  I work remotely in [Greenville, SC](http://lifeingreenville.com) as a senior software developer and consultant for [Kingdom First](https://kingdomfirstsolutions.com).  I get excited about sushi, music, card games, spreadsheets, and the outdoors, but not usually in that order.

Want to connect, chat, or ask a question?  My [DM's](/contact) are always open.

### My Background:

I was a senior web developer for over 5 years at NewSpring Church, who had 35k weekly attendees, 180k+ user profiles, and 19 locations across South Carolina.  I led the transition to and development of Rock RMS as a single source of truth to automate internal processes, revamp their user portal, and build native apps.

Before that, I was a software contractor for law enforcement, network architect for a law firm, and other jobs where I usually tried to take something apart, break it, then get it back working again. 


### Biography:

David is a web developer with over a decade's worth of mistakes and problem solving to show for it.  He loves finding ways to be more efficient, doing things with intensity, and sleeping outdoors.  He's active on Twitter and his website, [davidstevens.us](https://davidstevens.us), unless he's spending time with his wife and daughter.
