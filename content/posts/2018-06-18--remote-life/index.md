# Remote life is the dream

When I first heard of remote work, I was young and single, blowing every paycheck, squeezing independence out of adulthood like the lime on a midnight taco.  

I imagined the possibilities of working remotely: the swanky lounge of a cruise ship, a hammock overlooking the Caribbean, the front porch of a Himalayan mountain cabin.  I'd become a [digital nomad](https://twitter.com/levelsio), capitalize on favorable currency rates, meet and become fast friends with strangers at a dive bar in Tokyo.

So what if I don't live the American dream?  Do I really need a mortgage, student loans, coworkers and a commute I don't like in order to "make it"?

# Quality of life is the reality

Fast forward to now: I'm young, married, saving every paycheck, and squeezing the time from every day like the lime on a homemade taco.  I smile when I think of the possibility of family picnics, finishing my day out on the patio, and grabbing coffee and sushi midweek with my best friends.

When I started working remotely, the comments rolled in: some incredulous, some disapproving, some jealous.  Despite the  [research](https://blog.shrm.org/sites/default/files/reports/WorkFlex%20Spotlight.pdf) [challenging](https://blog.hubstaff.com/why-remote-work-is-better/) [office](https://www.inc.com/brian-de-haaff/only-7-of-office-workers-are-productive-but-most-are-miserable.html) [norms](https://qz.com/891537/if-you-dont-trust-your-employees-to-work-remotely-you-shouldnt-have-hired-them-in-the-first-place), most people dismissed the idea.  My barber said he'd just watch Netflix, my doctor said it'd never work in her industry, and my family asked if I would ever shower again (that's another story).

What I realized was this: some would rather give up on a dream than try for it and fail.

# Creating reality isn't easy

Spending a few hours alone is refreshing.

Spending a few days alone is manageable, but occasionally boring.

Spending months alone requires motivation, organization, emotionally stability, and social engagements that don't involve workplace proximity associates.  You have to communicate and document _everything_, preferably in the most visible space available.  You need to set personal and professional expectations, like core working hours and dedicated office space but also annual IRL's with coworkers.  You make changes once in a while to bounce out of a funk.

Dreaming about remote work is easy.  The hard part is making the dream come true.

It's also completely worth it.
