I’m an engineering lead located in <a href="http://lifeingreenville.com">Greenville, SC</a> with 20+ years of full-stack expertise in enterprise and open source software. I’ve been fortunate to work in product, agency and management roles where I learned the value of collaboration and efficiency to drive organization success.</p>\n<p>In my current role at <a href="https://bluemodus.com">BlueModus</a>, I lead two engineering teams to create, optimize, and deliver .NET software for mid-size to Fortune 500 clients. My day-to-day ranges from personal coaching, code reviews and client onboarding, to architecting projects and planning sprints. </p>\n<p>Want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidclarkestevens/">connect</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=218521189">chat</a>, or <a href="hello@davidstevens.us">ask a question</a>?  I’m always up for a conversation.</p>\n<h3>My Background</h3>\n<p>For the past 5 years, I’ve guided engineering teams in various capacities and roles.  As a development director, I recruited and mentored direct reports, closed sales opportunities, and planned and presented strategic growth plans.  As a product owner, I engaged clients through technical roadmapping, estimation, design, documentation and implementation.  As a team lead, I provided hands-on expertise and collaborative solutions to meet deadlines and promote team development.</p>\n<p>As an individual contributor, I led development and ETL processes of an open-source .NET CRM and CMS designed for non-profits.  I designed and optimized microservices and API’s for Azure and on-premise environments, ensuring best practices for security, performance, and uptime.  Tooling I built directly converted over 50M+ records from proprietary systems, saving at least $1M per year in licensing costs.  At scale, this system supported React Native apps for an organization with 35k weekly attendees, 180k+ user profiles, and 19 locations across South Carolina.</p>\n<p>Prior to that, I worked as a software contractor for law enforcement, as a network analyst for a law firm, and a few other roles where I tried to take something apart, break it, and get it working again.</p>\n<h3>My Biography</h3>\n<p><img src="../avatar.jpg" alt="avatar" width="120" align="left" /><p style="padding-left:125px;"> David is an engineering lead with two decades worth of mistakes, problem solving, and persistence to show for it.  He loves finding ways to be more efficient, doing things with intensity, and sleeping outdoors whenever he can.</p>\n<p>You can find him on Twitter and his website, <a href="https://davidstevens.us">davidstevens.us</a>, except when he’s spending time with his family.</p></p>',frontmatter:{title:"About"}},site:{siteMetadata:{facebook:{appId:""}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
